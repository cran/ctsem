\usage{
ctStanDiscretePars(ctstanfitobj, subjects = "all", times = seq(from =
  0, to = 10, by = 0.1), quantiles = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975),
  nsamples = 500, observational = FALSE, standardise = FALSE,
  plot = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctstanfitobj}{Continuous time model fit from \code{\link{ctStanFit}}}

\item{subjects}{Either 'all', to take the average over all subjects, or a vector of integers denoting which
subjects.}

\item{times}{Numeric vector of positive values, discrete time parameters will be calculated for each.}

\item{quantiles}{Which quantiles to return. If plotting, specify 3 quantiles, 
the 2nd will be plotted as a line with 1 and 3 as uncertainty bounds.}

\item{nsamples}{Number of samples from the stanfit to use for plotting. Higher values will
increase smoothness / accuracy, at cost of plotting speed. Values greater than the total
number of samples will be set to total samples.}

\item{observational}{Logical. If TRUE, outputs expected change in processes *conditional on observing* a 1 unit change in each -- 
this change is correlated according to the DIFFUSION matrix. If FALSE, outputs expected regression values -- also interpretable as
an independent 1 unit change on each process, giving the expected response under a 1 unit experimental impulse.}

\item{standardise}{Logical. If TRUE, output is standardised according to expected total within subject variance, given by the 
asymDIFFUSION matrix.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If TRUE, plots output using \code{\link{ctStanDiscreteParsPlot}}
instead of returning output.}

\item{...}{additional plotting arguments to control \code{\link{ctStanDiscreteParsPlot}}}
}
\description{
Calculate model implied regressions for a sequence of time intervals based on a continuous time model fit
from ctStanFit, for specified subjects.
