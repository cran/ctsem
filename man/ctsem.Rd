\description{
ctsem is an R package for continuous time structural equation modelling of panel (N > 1) 
and time series (N = 1) data, using either a frequentist or Bayesian approach. 
The frequentist approach is faster but can only estimate random-effects on the intercepts, 
while the Bayesian approach allows for random-effects across all model parameters.
}
\details{
The general workflow begins by specifying a model using the \code{\link{ctModel}} function, 
in which the \code{type} of model is also specified. Then the model is fit to data using 
either \code{\link{ctFit}} if an 'omx' (OpenMx, frequentist) model is specified or 
\code{\link{ctStanFit}} if a 'stanct' or 'standt' (Stan, continuous / discrete time, Bayesian)
model is specified. 
For examples, see either \code{\link{ctFit}} or \code{\link{ctStanFit}}. 
For more detailed information, see the frequentist vignette by running: \code{vignette('ctsem')}
