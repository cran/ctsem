\title{Get time independent predictor effect estimates}
\usage{
ctStanTIpredeffects(fit, returndifference = FALSE, probs = c(0.025,
  0.5, 0.975), includeMeanUncertainty = FALSE, whichTIpreds = 1,
  parmatrices = TRUE, whichpars = "all", nsamples = 100,
  timeinterval = 1, nsubjects = 50, filter = NA, plot = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{fit object from \code{\link{ctStanFit}}}

\item{returndifference}{logical. If FALSE, absolute parameter values are returned. 
If TRUE, only the effect of the covariate (i.e. without the average value of the parameter)
are returned. The former can be easier to interpret, but the latter are more likely to fit multiple plots together. 
Not used if \code{parmatrices=TRUE}.}

\item{probs}{numeric vector of quantile probabilities from 0 to 1. Specify 3
values if plotting, the 2nd will be drawn as a line with uncertainty polygon
based on 1st and 3rd.}

\item{includeMeanUncertainty}{if TRUE, output includes sampling variation in the mean parameters. If FALSE,
mean parameters are fixed at their median, only uncertainty in time independent predictor effects is included.}

\item{whichTIpreds}{integer vector specifying which of the tipreds in the fit object you want to
use to calculate effects. Unless quadratic / higher order versions of predictors have been 
included, selecting more than one probably doesn't make sense. If for instance a squared
predictor has been included, then you can specify both the linear and squared version. 
The x axis of the plot (if generated) will be based off the first indexed predictor. To 
check what predictors are in the model, run \code{fit$ctstanmodel$TIpredNames}.}

\item{parmatrices}{Logical. If TRUE (default), the \code{\link{ctStanParMatrices}} function
is used to return an expanded range of possible matrices of interest.}

\item{whichpars}{if parmatrices==TRUE, character vector specifying which matrices, and potentially which 
indices of the matrices, to plot. c('dtDRIFT[2,1]', 'DRIFT') would output for row 2 and column 1 of 
the discrete time drift matrix, as well as all indices of the continuous time drift matrix. 
If parmatrices==FALSE, integer vector specifying which of the subject
level parameters to compute effects on. The integers corresponding to certain parameters can be found in the 
\code{param} column of the \code{fit$setup$popsetup} object. In either case 'all' uses all available parameters.}

\item{nsamples}{Positive integer specifying the maximum number of saved iterations to use. 
Character string 'all' can also be used.}

\item{timeinterval}{positive numeric indicating time interval to use for discrete time parameter matrices,
if \code{parmatrices=TRUE}.}

\item{nsubjects}{Positive integer specifying the number of subjects to compute values for.
Character string 'all' can also be used. Time taken is a function of nsubjects*niterations.}

\item{filter}{either NA, or a length 2 vector, where the first element contains the time independent predictor index
to filter by, and the second contains the comparison operator in string form (e.g. "< 3",
to only calculate effects for subjects where the tipreds of the denoted index are less than 3).}

\item{plot}{Logical. If TRUE, nothing is returned but instead \code{\link{ctPlotArray}}
is used to plot the output instead.}

\item{...}{arguments to pass to \code{\link{ctPlotArray}} for plotting.}
}
\value{
Either a three dimensional array of predictor effects, or nothing with a plot
generated.
}
\description{
